    <p style="background-color:skyblue">His Majesty The King visited the De-suung Skilling Centre at Dzongkhalum, Trongsa on Tuesday and Wednesday to inspect the facility and meet with the first cohort of De-Suups participating in training programmes there.

The De-Suung Skilling Programme (DSP) is a series of multiple short-term accelerated training by local and foreign experts, focusing on practical, hands-on skilling, customised for our youth.

Since the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic, close to 18,000 men and women joined De-Suung and went on to volunteer for duty across the country. In appreciation of their extraordinary expression of solidarity to the nation, His Majesty Commanded that the State must reciprocate by providing opportunities for the youth of Bhutan to enhance their capabilities and empower them to participate more meaningfully in the process of nation-building.</p>
